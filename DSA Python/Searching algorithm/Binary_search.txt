		Binary search also called as half_interval search algorithm.
It finds the position of a search element within a sorted array.
The binary search algorithm can be done as divide-and-conquer algorithm and executes in logarithmic time.


Pseudo code for Binary search:-


	1.  Start with the middle element:

		• If the search element is equal to the Middle element of the array 
		i.e., the middle value = number of elements in the array /2. 
		Then return the index of middle element,

		• If not, then compare the middle element with the search value,

		• If the search element is greater than the nuber in the middle index,
		then select the elements to the right side of the middle index ,
		and goto Step-1.

		• If the search element is less then the number in the middle index ,
		then select the elements to the left side of the middle index,
		and start with Step-1.


	2.  When a match is found , display success message eith the index of the element matched.


	3.  if no match is found for all comparisons, then display unsuccessful message.
