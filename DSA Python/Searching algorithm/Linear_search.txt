        Linear search also called sequential search is a sequential method for finding a particular value in a list.
This method checks the search element with each element in sequence until the desired element is found or list is exhausted.
In this searching algorithm, list need not be ordered.



Pseudo Code for Linear seach :-

    1. Traverse the array using for loop.


    2. In every iteration, compare the target search key value with the current value of the list.
    
        •If the value matches, display the current index and value of the array 
    
        •If the value do not match, move on to the next array element.


    3. If no match is found display the search element not found.
